## Smart Routing

On every user prompt involving a dev task, sense context before acting:
1. Check git state (branch, staged/unstaged files)
2. Detect platform from changed file extensions (`.tsx`→web, `.swift`→ios, `.kt`→android, `.java`→backend)
3. Check for active plans in `./plans/`
4. Route to best-fit skill based on intent + context

**This applies to every prompt — not just `/epost` invocations.**

### Prompt Classification
- **Dev task** (action verbs: cook, fix, plan, test, debug, etc.) → route via intent map below
- **Kit question** ("which agent", "list skills", "our conventions") → route to `epost-project-manager`
- **External tech question** ("how does React...", "what is gRPC") → route to `epost-researcher`
- **Conversational** (greetings, opinions, clarifications) → respond directly, no routing

### Intent → Skill Map

| Intent | Signal Words | Routes To |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Build | cook, implement, build, create, add, make, continue | `/cook` |
| Fix | fix, broken, error, crash, failing, what's wrong | `/fix` |
| Plan | plan, design, architect, spec, roadmap | `/plan` |
| Test | test, coverage, validate, verify | `/test` |
| Debug | debug, trace, inspect, diagnose | `/debug` |
| Review | review, check code, audit | `/review --code` |
| Git | commit, push, pr, merge, done, ship | `/git --commit`, `/git --push`, `/git --pr` |
| Docs | docs, document, write docs | `/docs` |
| Scaffold | bootstrap, init, scaffold, new project, new module | `/bootstrap` |
| Convert | convert, prototype, migrate | `/convert` |
| A11y | a11y, accessibility, wcag | `/fix --a11y` or `/review --a11y` |
| Onboard | get started, begin, onboard, new to project, what is this | `/get-started` |
| Journal | journal, postmortem, what went wrong, failure log | `epost-journal-writer` (direct) |
| Simplify | simplify, refactor, clean up, reduce complexity | `/cook` (simplification mode) |
| MCP | mcp, tools, discover tools, rag query | `epost-mcp-manager` (direct) |
| Design | design, ui, ux, wireframe, screenshot to code, visual asset | `epost-muji` (direct) |

### Context Boost Rules
- TypeScript/build errors detected → always route to `/fix` first
- Staged files present → boost Git or Review intent
- Active plan file exists → boost Build intent ("continue" → `/cook`)
- Merge conflicts → suggest fix/resolve
- Feature branch with no changes → boost Plan or Build

### Rules
- If user types a slash command explicitly → execute it directly, skip routing
- If ambiguous → use context boost to break tie; if still ambiguous → ask user (max 1 question)
- If multi-intent ("plan and build X") → delegate to `epost-project-manager`
