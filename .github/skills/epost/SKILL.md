# Smart Hub v2 — `/epost`

The intelligent entry point to the epost agent ecosystem. Senses your current work context, detects intent from natural language, chains multi-step workflows, and shows contextual suggestions.

## Execution Flow

On every invocation, follow these steps **in order**:

### Step 1: Gather Context Snapshot

**Before parsing arguments**, follow the `hub-context` Context Snapshot Protocol to gather git state, platform detection, error signals, and session hints. Produce the context summary format defined there.

### Step 2: Parse Intent from Arguments

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty → skip to Step 4 (Contextual Discovery Menu).

Otherwise, classify the request using **semantic intent categories**:

#### Intent Categories

| Category | Signal Words | Context Boost | Routes To |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Build** | cook, implement, build, create, add, scaffold, make, continue | Has plan file → boost | `/cook` or orchestrator |
| **Fix** | fix, debug, error, crash, broken, failing, wrong, what's wrong | Has error signals → boost | `/fix` (auto-detects error type) |
| **Plan** | plan, design, architect, think about, spec, roadmap | Complex request → boost | `/plan` (auto-detects complexity) |
| **Test** | test, coverage, validate, verify, check tests, run tests | Has test failures → boost | `/test` (auto-detects platform) |
| **Review** | review, check code, audit, look at, inspect | Has staged changes → boost | `/review-code` |
| **Git** | commit, push, pr, merge, branch, release, done, ship | Has staged changes → boost | `/git-{action}` |
| **Docs** | docs, document, write docs, readme | — | `/docs-init` or `/docs-update` |
| **Explore** | scout, search, find, explore, where is, show me | — | `/scout` skill |
| **Knowledge** | which agent, list agents/skills/commands, what's our, convention, kit, our agents, our skills, what rag | Internal ref | `epost-orchestrator` |
| **Components** | what components, search components, find component, design tokens | RAG query | `epost-orchestrator` |
| **Research** | research, what is [external tech], how does [external tech], best practice for [tech] | External tech ref | `epost-researcher` |
| **A11y** | a11y, accessibility, wcag, screen reader, voiceover | — | `/review-a11y` or `/fix-a11y` |
| **Brainstorm** | brainstorm, evaluate, compare, think about options, weigh | — | `epost-brainstormer` |
| **Guide** | guide, help me, how do I, wizard | — | Show discovery menu or `epost-orchestrator` |
| **Convert** | convert, prototype, migrate | — | `/convert` |
| **Bootstrap** | bootstrap, init, scaffold new | — | `/bootstrap` (auto-detects scope) |

#### Context Boost Rules

When context signals match a category, that category gets priority **even with weaker keyword matches**:

| Context Signal | Boosts Category | Example |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| TypeScript/build errors detected | Fix | "what's wrong?" → `/fix` (auto-detects types) |
| Staged files present | Git or Review | "I'm done" → `/git-commit` |
| Active plan file exists | Build | "continue" → `/cook-fast` with plan |
| Test failures detected | Fix | "help" → `/fix` (auto-detects test failures) |
| Feature branch, no changes yet | Build or Plan | "what's next?" → resume from plan |
| Clean main branch, no work | Plan or Explore | show contextual menu |
| Merge conflicts | Fix | "help" → suggest conflict resolution |

#### Internal vs External Knowledge Detection

When the request is a knowledge question ("what is...", "how does...", "ask about..."):

**Route to epost-orchestrator** when referencing internal kit concepts:
- Keywords: "our", "we", "agent", "skill", "command", "kit", "rag", "convention", "module", "component"

**Route to epost-researcher** when referencing external tech:
- No internal keywords present + mentions specific technologies, libraries, or frameworks

#### Fuzzy Matching

Don't require exact keyword matches. Use semantic understanding:
- "my tests are broken" → Fix (via "broken") + Test (via "tests"). Context boost breaks the tie.
- "I need to change the button" → Build (change ≈ modify ≈ implement)
- "what happened?" → context boost determines: if errors → Fix; if clean → Explore
- "I'm stuck" → if errors → Fix; if plan exists → Build; else → Guide

### Step 3: Detect Multi-Intent and Route

#### Multi-Intent Detection

Check for compound requests via conjunctions:

**Triggers**: "and", "then", "after that", "followed by", comma-separated action verbs, semicolons

| Pattern | Intent Chain | Delegation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| "plan and build X" | [Plan, Build] | → orchestrator |
| "fix the bug then commit" | [Fix, Git] | → orchestrator |
| "test and review" | [Test, Review] | → orchestrator |
| "plan, implement, and test the feature" | [Plan, Build, Test] | → orchestrator |

**If multi-intent detected** → delegate to `epost-orchestrator` with a structured handoff (see Orchestrator Delegation below).

#### Single Intent Routing

**If single intent detected:**

1. **Platform prefix check**: If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `ios`, `android`, `web`, or `backend`, route to platform-specific command.
2. **Variant auto-selection** based on complexity:

| Complexity Signal | Variant |
|-------------------|---------|
| Single file + clear error | `:fast` |
| 2-5 files, one module | `:fast` |
| Multiple modules, some unknowns | `:deep` |
| Multi-platform or needs research | `:deep` or `:parallel` |
| Has existing plan with phases | `:parallel` (follow plan) |

3. **Route directly** to the matched command.

#### Routing Decision Report

**Always** show the user what you decided and why:

```
Routing to `/fix` — detected TypeScript errors on web platform (branch: feature/auth)
```

or

```
Delegating to orchestrator — multi-intent detected: [Plan, Build] for notification system (web)
```

### Step 4: Contextual Discovery Menu

When invoked with **no arguments**, show a context-aware menu instead of the static command list.

#### If active work detected (staged files, errors, plan):

```markdown
## Suggested Actions

You're on `{branch}` with {context_summary}.

| # | Action | Command | Why |
|---|--------|---------|-----|
| 1 | {most relevant action} | `{command}` | {reason from context} |
| 2 | {second action} | `{command}` | {reason} |
| 3 | {third action} | `{command}` | {reason} |
| 4 | {fourth action} | `{command}` | {reason} |

> Describe what you want to do, or type a number. Full command list: say "show all commands"
```

**Priority rules for suggestions:**
1. If merge conflicts → suggest fix/resolve first
2. If errors → suggest fix commands
3. If staged files → suggest commit or review
4. If active plan → suggest continuing implementation
5. If feature branch, no changes → suggest starting work or checking plan
6. Always include at least one "escape hatch" (explore, plan, help)

#### If clean state (main branch, no changes, no errors):

```markdown
## What do you want to do?

No active work detected on `{branch}`.

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Plan a feature | `/epost plan ...` |
| Build something | `/epost build ...` |
| Fix an issue | `/epost fix ...` |
| Explore codebase | `/epost scout ...` |
| Ask about the kit | `/epost which agent handles X?` |
| Research external tech | `/epost research ...` |

> Describe what you want to do in natural language.
```

#### Full command list (on "show all commands"):

```
### All Commands

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| Core Verbs | `/cook`, `/test`, `/debug`, `/fix`, `/plan`, `/bootstrap` |
| Planning | `/plan-fast`, `/plan-deep`, `/plan-parallel`, `/plan-validate` |
| Building | `/cook-fast`, `/cook-parallel`, `/bootstrap-fast`, `/bootstrap-parallel` |
| Fixing | `/fix-deep`, `/fix-ci`, `/fix-ui`, `/fix-a11y` |
| Review | `/review-code`, `/review-a11y`, `/audit-a11y` |
| Git | `/git-commit`, `/git-push`, `/git-pr` |
| Docs | `/docs-init`, `/docs-update`, `/docs-component` |
| Tools | `/convert`, `/simulator` |
| Kit | `/kit-add-agent`, `/kit-add-skill`, `/kit-add-hook`, `/kit-optimize-skill` |
| CLI | `/cli-cook`, `/cli-test`, `/cli-doctor` |
| Accessibility | `/audit-a11y`, `/audit-close-a11y`, `/fix-a11y`, `/review-a11y` |
```

## Orchestrator Delegation

When delegating to `epost-orchestrator`, provide a structured handoff:

```markdown
## Hub Handoff

**Original request**: "{user's exact words}"
**Intent chain**: [{Category1}, {Category2}, ...]
**Suggested commands**: [{/command1}, {/command2}, ...]
**Context**:
  - Branch: {branch_name}
  - Platform: {detected_platform}
  - Staged: {count} files
  - Errors: {summary}
  - Plan: {plan_file or "none"}
**Delegation reason**: {why hub can't handle directly — multi-intent / ambiguous platform / project-level}
```

**Delegation triggers:**
- Multi-intent chain detected (2+ intents)
- Ambiguous platform (files from multiple platforms changed)
- Project oversight request ("status", "progress", "what's left")
- Multi-platform task ("test everything", "review all platforms")

## Platform Hint Detection

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with a platform name, pass it as a hint to the unified verb command:

| Prefix | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `ios ...` | Forces `/cook`, `/test`, `/debug` to use iOS agent |
| `android ...` | Forces `/cook`, `/test`, `/debug` to use Android agent |
| `web ...` | Forces `/cook`, `/test`, `/debug` to use Web agent |
| `backend ...` | Forces `/cook`, `/test`, `/debug` to use Backend agent |

## Rules

- **ALWAYS** gather context before routing (Step 1 is mandatory)
- If no clear intent detected → show contextual discovery menu
- If ambiguous between two intents → use context boost to break tie; if still ambiguous → ask user (max 1 question)
- Always show the routing decision and reasoning before executing
- Prefer fast variants unless complexity clearly warrants deep
- Multi-intent requests → always delegate to orchestrator
- Context gathering should be fast (< 5 seconds total). Skip slow checks.
- If not in a git repo, skip git state gracefully and proceed with intent-only routing
